Battle Harems

Harems that involve fighing, often with a magical academy setting. Cute girls, nonsensical plots, and hijinks await.

|Unlimited Fafnir|

With the sudden appearance of the monsters that came to be called dragons, the world had completely changed. Before long, supernatural girls with the power of the dragons, called "D", were born within the human race. The secret existence of the only male "D", the boy Mononobe Yuu, was forcefully thrown into the school where the girls of "D" gathered - Midgard, where he saw the naked body of one of the students, Iris. Furthermore, upon meeting his long lost sister Mitsuki, Yuu seems to have been enrolled into this school...!? "When there's really no other choice, Iris, I will--kill you." "Can I really... believe you?" The curtains open as the "one and only story" about the boy who was supposed to become the strongest assassin and the poorly performing girl unfolds--!

Like just about every entry on this section, Unlimited Fafnir doesn't do anything unique--it's filled with the same old tropes and shticks. But, it does them *well*. The girls are cute and likable, the main character is mostly competent, the writing is okay, and very importantly, the translation is great. Combat-wise, due to how the fights usually go, the series thankfully lacks giant walls of text describing fights. The plot actually does move forward.

As I mentioned before, the translation, for being a fan work, is among the better ones, which definitely scores in its favor.

|Leviathan of the Covenant|

A modern era when humanity is threatened by attacks from giant dragons flying from beyond the sky. Controlling "leviathans"-serpentine spiritual beings created through magic-humanity is locked in a protracted war of resistance against the dragons. Fortunately, there exist witches known as "magi"-battle maidens of salvation who formed covenants with "serpents" in order to combat dragons. Nicknamed Hal, the young man called Haruga Haruomi makes his living through facilitating the covenants of these girls. At the (partially coercive) request of his childhood friend Asya, one of Europe's top witches, Hal returns to Tokyo New Town after an absence of three years.

From the author of Campione! is another battle harem, but, perhaps having learned from past mistakes, this one is of higher quality. The girls are cute and there are none that are particularly annoying--no tsunderes this time. The main character is a bit more fun than usual, and the banter with the girls is one of the series highlights. The plot has no clear direction at the moment.

The translation quality is top notch for a fan translation. Few grammar mistakes, and the sentences flow well.

|Magika No Kenshi To Shoukan Maou|

Because of a Diva governing summoning Magic awarding a stigma, the Sword Division's expert - Kazuki entered the National Knight's Academy's Magic Division. Even though he should be honing the sword skills inherited from Hayashizaki-Ryuu, Kazuki began his unsure Magic training in the Magic Division, which was filled with girls. As Kazuki's sister, Kanae, the current student president of Sword Division, was extremely unsatisfied about Kazuki entering Magic Division to study. And the Magic Division Student President was overly close to Kazuki made Kanae extremely unhappy--? Kazuki stands inside the crevice between the two conflicting Student Presidents! With the proof of a Summon Magic User - Stigma, the academy's battle arena targeting both Sword and Magic, is about to begin--!

This one leans more toward softcore porn than anything else, so I'll cut to the chase. This series is great if you like a few things: 1) cute girls, 2) a lot of intimacy and skinship, 3) a very forward main character. To elaborate more on the last point, Kazuki isn't a genius or super strong, but if you like a guy who's not afraid of romantic encounters, this is your man.

One major issue is the translation. It's... readable, I'll say that. But no more.

|Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance|

Only a pure maiden can have the privilege to contract with a spirit. At Areishia Spirit Academy, trained maidens of noble families are gathered and given an elite's education to become elementalists. The protagonist, Kamito, accidentally peeped on a bathing girl, Claire, and ended up making a contract with the spirit she wanted. Indeed, as a male elementalist, Kamito is an irregularity whose existence was hitherto thought impossible. "You stole...my spirit...you have to take responsibility for it!" "Huh?" "You have to become my contracted spirit!" Where will Kamito's destiny lead to?

This one is on here partly for nostalgic reasons. Unlike, say, Magika, there isn't as much intimacy, but there is a greater focus on the plot, which really gets going after the titular Blade Dance begins. Combat-wise, I'd rank this one among the better ones.

The translation quality is okay. Not too many grammatical or spelling mistakes, but it doesn't flow particularly well.

|Madan no Ou Vanadis|
vanadis.jpg
In times of war, set in Western Europe, Eleonora Viltaria, one of the seven Vanadis of Zhcted, leads the war into Brune. There are actually seven Vanadis, named like this because they each received a powerful weapon from the dragon, to reign over seven territories, each possessing their own. The power of the Vanadis causes dread and fear toward their enemies. An Earl in the service of the country of Brune, a young archer called Tigre, got a taste of it after he was defeated on the battlefield by Ellen (Eleonora). However, Ellen decided to spare his life after seeing his skills. In exchange, he is asked to serve Ellen....

This one is special for it's partial nature as a war drama--and one that tries to be authentic, as well! It obviously has a more serious plot and tone, though the overarching plot isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 

Translation-wise, interestingly enough, from a grammar and syntax point of view, the earlier machine translated novels are better translated than the later ones, though of course I can't vouch for their accuracy to the source. Afterwards, it's okay. Not as bad as Magika, but there are definitely quite a few grammatical errors and awkward sentences.

|Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?|

The story follows the exploits of Bell Cranel, a 14-year-old solo adventurer under the goddess Hestia. As the only member of the Hestia Familia, he works hard every day in the dungeon to make ends meet while seeking to improve himself. He looks up to Aiz Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman who once saved his life, and with whom he fell in love. He is unaware that several other girls, deities and mortals alike, also develop affections towards him; most notably Hestia herself, as he also gains allies and improves himself with each new challenge he faces.

Now famous (or infamous) for the boob string craze, DanMachi as the fans have shortened it, is unique for 2 things: it's main character, and the world. 

DanMachi takes place in an RPG-like world. No transportation, the RPG elements simply exist.

Bell, the main character, *is* unique, though he has gotten some flack for being generic. What sets Bell apart is his weakness--not necessarily in strength, though he is physically weak in the beginning, but in the relationships. He is on the weaker side of pretty much every relationship he has with every other character, which is different than most main characters of battle harems. So if you like a main character who gets taken care of, this is great; otherwise, you may not like it.

After being taken up Yen Press, the translation is quite good.
